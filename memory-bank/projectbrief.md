# Project Brief: AI Book Agent Platform (Backend Server)

## 1. Project Name

AI Book Agent Platform (Backend Server)

## 2. Core Mission

To develop a robust and scalable backend system for the AI Book Agent Platform. This backend will handle the ingestion and vectorization of book content, manage interactions with AI agents, and expose these functionalities via a REST API.

## 3. Project Scope

This phase focuses exclusively on the **backend server** component of the AI Book Agent Platform. The backend will be developed in Python using Flask, LangChain, Pinecone, and Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK).

Key functionalities include:

- Uploading and processing pre-chunked book contexts.
- Embedding text chunks and storing them in a Pinecone vector database.
- Providing API endpoints for:
  - Chatting with a book.
  - Generating short Q&A.
  - Generating long Q&A.
  - Selecting the best answer from a list.
  - Health checks.
- Orchestrating AI agents built with Google ADK.

The backend server code and related files will be organized within a dedicated "server" directory.
Frontend development has commenced using Next.js and Tailwind CSS, with initial setup and color palette definition completed. The frontend code resides in the "frontend" directory.

## 4. High-Level Goals

- **Functional Backend**: Deliver a fully functional backend system meeting all requirements outlined in the PRD.
- **Modularity**: Design the system with a modular architecture to facilitate easy maintenance and future extensions.
- **Scalability**: Ensure the backend can handle a growing number of books and user interactions.
- **Performance**: Achieve fast query response times, particularly for agent interactions.
- **Security**: Implement necessary security measures for API endpoints and secret management.

## 5. Source of Truth

The primary source of truth for requirements and features is the `PRD.md` document. This project brief provides a high-level summary and context for the backend development effort.
