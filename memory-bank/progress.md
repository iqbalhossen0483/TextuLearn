# Progress: AI Book Agent Platform

## What Works

**Backend:**

- Initial project structure is in place.
- Python virtual environment setup is confirmed.
- The `REDIS_URL` format in `server/.env` has been corrected.
- `celery` has been added to `server/requirements.txt`.
- Celery configuration has been added to `server/config/settings.py`.
- `server/services/queue/celery_config.py` defines the `celery_app` instance.
- **API Route Modularization**:
  - `server/routes/train_routes.py`: Created, housing the `/api/train/` POST endpoint in its own Blueprint (`train_bp`).
  - `server/routes/main.py`: Cleaned up, no longer contains the `/api/train` route.
  - `server/app.py`: Successfully registers both `main_bp` and the new `train_bp`.
- `server/services/queue/tasks.py`:
  - **Completed `process_single_chunk_task`**: The task now integrates `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService`.
  - Updated `process_context_data` with improved logging.
- **Service Implementation**:
  - `server/services/embedding_service.py`: `EmbeddingService` implemented.
  - `server/services/vector_store_service.py`: `VectorStoreService` fixed by the user.
- **Python Packaging for Celery**: `__init__.py` files created in `server/services/` and `server/services/queue/`.
- Import paths corrected for running from `server/run.py`.

**Frontend:**

- **Project Initialization**: `frontend/` directory initialized with Next.js.
- **Styling Setup**: Tailwind CSS integrated into the Next.js project.
- **Global Styles**: Color palette defined in `frontend/src/app/globals.css`:
  ```css
  @theme inline {
    --color-primary: #1dc9b4;
    --color-primary-dark: #1a1a1a;
    --color-secondary: #e6faf8;
    --color-divider: #b0bec5;
    --color-secondary-text: #b0bec5;
    --color-highligh-blue: #80d8ff;
  }
  ```

**Memory Bank:**

- All core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) have been updated to reflect the commencement of frontend development, including new technologies (Next.js, Tailwind CSS) and the defined color palette.
- `progress.md` (this file) has been updated to reflect the current state.

## What's Left to Build

**Backend:**

- **Celery Worker Verification**: Continued monitoring to ensure tasks are processed correctly.
- **Configuration**: Verify all API keys and settings in `.env` and `server/config/settings.py`.
- **Testing**:
  - End-to-end testing of the `/api/train/` route.
  - Unit/integration tests for services and Celery tasks.
- **Core Functionalities**: Implement ADK agents and other API routes (chat, Q&A).

**Frontend:**

- **Basic UI Structure**: Develop layout components and basic page structure.
- **Component Development**: Create UI components for user interaction (e.g., file uploads, chat display, Q&A forms).
- **API Integration**: Connect frontend components to backend API endpoints.
- **State Management**: Implement a state management solution if needed.

## Current Status

The project now has foundational elements for both backend and frontend.
**Backend**: The data ingestion pipeline (`/api/train/` -> Celery -> Services) is largely in place and believed to be functional pending final verification of Celery worker behavior with real data.
**Frontend**: Initial setup is complete with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, including a defined color scheme. Development of UI components and features is the next major step.
The overall project is transitioning from a backend-only focus to full-stack development.

## Known Issues

- The `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` need to be correctly set in the `server/.env` file for the backend services to function.
- The `VectorStoreService` now attempts to create the index if it's missing, using default serverless spec parameters (`cloud='aws'`, `region='us-east-1'`). These might need to be made configurable if the user's Pinecone setup requires different settings.
- The role of `server/celery_app.py` (if it exists and defines a Celery app) versus `server/services/queue/celery_config.py` needs to be clarified to ensure there's a single source of truth for the Celery application instance. The current setup relies on `server.services.queue.celery_config.celery_app`.
