# Progress: AI Book Agent Platform

## What Works

- Initial project structure is in place.
- Python virtual environment setup is confirmed.
- The `REDIS_URL` format in `server/.env` has been corrected.
- `celery` has been added to `server/requirements.txt`.
- Celery configuration has been added to `server/config/settings.py`.
- `server/services/queue/celery_config.py` defines the `celery_app` instance.
- **API Route Modularization**:
  - `server/routes/train_routes.py`: Created, housing the `/api/train/` POST endpoint in its own Blueprint (`train_bp`).
  - `server/routes/main.py`: Cleaned up, no longer contains the `/api/train` route.
  - `server/app.py`: Successfully registers both `main_bp` and the new `train_bp`.
- `server/services/queue/tasks.py`:
  - **Completed `process_single_chunk_task`**: The task now integrates `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService` to replace previous placeholder logic for embedding generation and Pinecone upsertion. Import paths are corrected.
  - Updated `process_context_data` (previously `proccess_context_data`) with improved logging.
- **Service Implementation**:
  - `server/services/embedding_service.py`: **Implemented** `EmbeddingService` using `langchain_google_genai.GoogleGenerativeAIEmbeddings` (model `models/embedding-001`).
  - `server/services/vector_store_service.py`: **User-Updated and Fixed** `VectorStoreService`. The user resolved a `TypeError` during Pinecone client initialization. The fix involved:
    - Initializing `Pinecone` client without the `environment` parameter: `Pinecone(api_key=Config.PINECONE_API_KEY)`.
    - Correctly checking for index existence using `if self.index_name not in self.pinecone.list_indexes().names():` by calling `.names()` as a method.
    - User also removed the explicit wait loop after index creation.
- **Python Packaging for Celery**:
  - Created `server/services/__init__.py` and `server/services/queue/__init__.py`. This ensures `services` and `services.queue` are recognized as Python packages, essential for Celery's task discovery. This resolved earlier `KeyError` issues for unregistered Celery tasks.
- Memory bank documentation (`techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`) updated to reflect Celery integration, service implementations/fixes, and Python packaging.
- Import paths have been corrected to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` when running from `server/run.py`.

## What's Left to Build

- **Celery Worker Verification**:
  - The user has indicated the Pinecone initialization issue is solved, implying the Celery worker now processes tasks correctly.
- **Configuration**:
  - Ensure `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`, etc., are correctly configured in `.env` and loaded by `server/config/settings.py`.
- **Testing**:
  - End-to-end testing of the `/api/train/` route with Celery workers.
  - Unit/integration tests for the new services and Celery tasks.
  - Verification that all Blueprints are correctly routed.
- **Other Backend Functionalities**: Implement other core features (ADK agents, other API routes for chat, Q&A, etc.).
- **Frontend Development**: (Future phase).

## Current Status

The backend's data ingestion pipeline is now more modular. The `/api/train/` endpoint is defined in its own Blueprint and correctly registered. It receives book data and queues a Celery task (`process_single_chunk_task`) for each chunk. This task calls methods on `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService`. With the user's fix to `VectorStoreService` and previous fixes for Celery task registration, the data ingestion pathway is believed to be functional.

## Known Issues

- The `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` need to be correctly set in the `.env` file for the services to function.
- The `VectorStoreService` now attempts to create the index if it's missing, using default serverless spec parameters (`cloud='aws'`, `region='us-east-1'`). These might need to be made configurable if the user's Pinecone setup requires different settings.
- The role of `server/celery_app.py` (if it exists and defines a Celery app) versus `server/services/queue/celery_config.py` needs to be clarified to ensure there's a single source of truth for the Celery application instance. The current setup relies on `server.services.queue.celery_config.celery_app`.
