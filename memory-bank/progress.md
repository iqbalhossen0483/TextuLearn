# Progress: AI Book Agent Platform

## What Works

- Initial project structure is in place.
- Python virtual environment setup is confirmed.
- The `REDIS_URL` format in `server/.env` has been corrected.
- `celery` has been added to `server/requirements.txt`.
- Celery configuration has been added to `server/config/settings.py`.
- `server/celery_app.py` has been created to initialize the Celery application.
- A sample Celery task has been defined in `server/services/queue_manager.py`.
- Memory bank documentation (`techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) has been updated to reflect Celery integration.
- Import paths have been corrected to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` when running from `server/run.py`.

## What's Left to Build

- Modifying `server/app.py` to integrate with the Celery queue system.
- Updating `server/routes/main.py` to use Celery tasks.
- Full testing of Celery task processing with workers.
- Implement core backend functionalities (agents, services, other routes).
- Integrate with Pinecone and Google Gemini.
- Develop frontend (future phase).

## Current Status

The backend environment is now set up with Celery and Redis as the queue system. The core task queue setup is in place, and the system is ready for further development and testing of core AI functionalities.

## Known Issues

- None at this moment. The next step is to run the Flask app and Celery worker to verify end-to-end task processing.
