# Progress: AI Book Agent Platform

## What Works

**Backend:**

- **Production-Level Authentication (Security Enhanced)**:
  - `server/routes/auth_routes.py` updated:
    - `/register` and `/login` routes now return a curated `user` object (id, email, created_at) in the response, excluding sensitive data like hashed passwords.
    - (Previous refinement: `/register` route generates and returns a JWT. `/register` no longer takes `username` input, requires `confirm_password`, and validates password matching. `/login` JWT payload and response include `email`.)
  - `PyJWT` added to `server/requirements.txt`.
  - `SECRET_KEY` added to `server/config/settings.py` (requires user to set in `.env`).
  - Password hashing (`werkzeug.security`) and JWT generation are in place.
- **MongoDB Integration**:
  - `pymongo` added to `server/requirements.txt`.
  - `MONGO_URL` added to `server/config/settings.py`.
  - `server/services/mongo_service.py` created with `MongoService` class.
  - `MongoService` initialized in `server/app.py`.
- **Auth Routes Blueprint**: `auth_bp` created and registered in `server/app.py`.
- **API Route Modularization**: `/api/train/` in `train_routes.py`.
- **Celery Task Processing**: `process_single_chunk_task` in `tasks.py` integrates `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService`.
- **Service Implementation**: `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService` are implemented.
- **Python Packaging**: Correct `__init__.py` files for services and queues.

**Frontend (Summarizing previous state):**

- **Books Page**: Implemented with search, list, and card components.
- **Responsiveness**: Home and Chatbot pages are responsive.
- **Chatbot UI**: Updated message input and session history panel.
- **Layout**: `PageShell.jsx` for conditional `NavBar`/`Footer`.
- **Componentization**: `ChatInterface.jsx` refactored.
- **Pages**: Chatbot, Register, Login pages created.
- **Core Components**: Footer, Banners, FAQ, Features, Buttons, NavBar.
- **Setup**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, global styles.

**Memory Bank:**

- All core memory bank files updated to reflect the latest backend authentication refinements, including secure user data responses.

## What's Left to Build

**Backend:**

- **Username Handling (Optional)**: Decide if and how `username` will be managed post-registration.
- **Protected Routes**: Implement JWT-based authentication middleware/decorator.
- **User Profile Management**: API endpoints for user profile operations.
- **Celery Worker Verification**: Ongoing monitoring.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing for all API endpoints and services.
- **Core Functionalities**: Implement ADK agents and other primary API routes (chat, Q&A).

**Frontend:**

- **Update Auth Forms & Logic**: Adapt registration and login logic to handle the curated `user` object and the token returned.
- **Auth Integration**: Connect UI to backend auth endpoints.
- **Token Handling**: Manage JWT on the client-side.
- **Protected Routes (Frontend)**: Implement route guards.
- **UI Development**: Continue building out features.

## Current Status

**Backend**: Authentication system is robust, production-oriented, provides a token immediately upon registration, and now returns curated user data in responses. MongoDB is integrated.
**Frontend**: Foundational UI established. Key next step is integrating with the refined backend authentication.
The project is actively in full-stack development.

## Known Issues

- **`SECRET_KEY` Configuration**: User MUST set a strong `SECRET_KEY` in `server/.env`.
- **`MONGO_URL` Configuration**: User MUST ensure `MONGO_URL` is correctly set in `server/.env`.
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` need to be correctly set in `server/.env`.
- Pinecone index creation defaults might need adjustment based on user's Pinecone setup.
