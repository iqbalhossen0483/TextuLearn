# Progress: AI Book Agent Platform (Backend Server)

## 1. What Works

- **PRD Available**: The `PRD.md` document has been successfully added to the project and relocated to `server/PRD.md`, outlining the core requirements and functionalities of the backend server.
- **Memory Bank Initialized**: The foundational memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated, providing a comprehensive overview of the project's context, architecture, and technical stack.
- **Initial File Organization**: The `PRD.md` file has been successfully moved into the `server/` directory, establishing the initial project structure as requested.

## 2. What's Left to Build

The primary development tasks for the backend server, as outlined in the `PRD.md`, are yet to be implemented. These include:

- **Core Flask Application**: Setting up the main Flask application (`app.py`).
- **API Routes**: Implementing all specified API endpoints (`/upload-book`, `/chat`, `/short-qa`, `/long-qa`, `/best-answer`, `/status`).
- **Service Layer**: Developing the `embedder.py`, `vector_store.py`, and `retriever.py` services.
- **AI Agents**: Creating the Google ADK agents (`chat_agent.py`, `short_qa_agent.py`, `long_qa_agent.py`, `best_answer_agent.py`).
- **Configuration**: Setting up `config/settings.py` and handling environment variables.
- **Dependency Management**: Creating `requirements.txt`.
- **Error Handling & Validation**: Implementing robust error handling, logging, and payload validation.
- **Testing**: Developing unit tests for endpoints and core functionalities.

## 3. Current Status

The project is in its very early stages. The initial setup, including comprehensive documentation and project structuring, is now complete. No functional code has been written yet.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this stage, as functional development has not yet begun.
