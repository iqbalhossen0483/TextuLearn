# Progress: AI Book Agent Platform

## What Works

**Backend:**

- **Chatbot Agent Logic & Route (`server/agents/runners/chatbot_agent.py` & `server/routes/agents.py`)**:
  - The `chatbot_agent_response` function in `chatbot_agent.py` is fully implemented:
    - Manages ADK agent interactions.
    - Integrates with MongoDB for session creation and message history (user & assistant).
    - Handles file uploads.
    - Streams responses (session ID, data, errors) asynchronously.
  - The `/chatbot` endpoint in `agents.py` correctly uses this logic for streaming chat.
- **Production-Level Authentication (Security Enhanced)**:
  - `server/routes/auth_routes.py` updated:
    - `/register` and `/login` routes now return a curated `user` object (id, email, created_at) in the response, excluding sensitive data like hashed passwords.
    - (Previous refinement: `/register` route generates and returns a JWT. `/register` no longer takes `username` input, requires `confirm_password`, and validates password matching. `/login` JWT payload and response include `email`.)
  - `PyJWT` added to `server/requirements.txt`.
  - `SECRET_KEY` added to `server/config/settings.py` (requires user to set in `.env`).
  - Password hashing (`werkzeug.security`) and JWT generation are in place.
- **MongoDB Integration**:
  - `pymongo` added to `server/requirements.txt`.
  - `MONGO_URL` added to `server/config/settings.py`.
  - `server/services/mongo_service.py` created with `MongoService` class.
  - `MongoService` initialized in `server/app.py`.
- **Auth Routes Blueprint**: `auth_bp` created and registered in `server/app.py`.
- **API Route Modularization**: `/api/train/` in `train_routes.py`.
- **Celery Task Processing**: `process_single_chunk_task` in `tasks.py` integrates `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService`.
- **Service Implementation**: `EmbeddingService` and `VectorStoreService` are implemented.
- **Python Packaging**: Correct `__init__.py` files for services and queues.

**Frontend:**

- **Chatbot Message Rendering (Markdown with Custom Styling)**:
  - Installed `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` in the `frontend` project.
  - Modified `frontend/src/components/chatbot/MessageItem.jsx` to use `ReactMarkdown` with `remarkGfm` plugin.
  - Added custom renderers via the `components` prop in `ReactMarkdown` to apply specific Tailwind CSS styles to various HTML tags (e.g., `h1`, `p`, `a`, `table`, `code`, `blockquote`), providing fine-grained control over the appearance of Markdown content.
- **Chatbot API Integration (using Fetch for streaming)**:
  - `frontend/src/services/chatService.js` updated: `sendChatMessageStream` now uses `fetch` for calling `/api/agent/chatbot` to better handle browser streaming (Note: `ChatInterface.jsx` directly uses `fetch` now, this service might be deprecated or used as a fallback).
  - `frontend/src/components/chatbot/ChatInterface.jsx` updated:
    - Directly uses `fetch` to call the `/agent/chatbot` endpoint.
    - Sends `question`, `user_id`, `session_id`, and `save` flag via `FormData`.
    - Handles streamed responses (JSON for session ID, data for messages, error for issues).
    - Manages `isLoading` state and provides a retry option on error.
  - `frontend/src/components/chatbot/MessageInput.jsx` remains updated to use `isLoading` prop to disable controls.
- **Mobile Navigation Refined**:
  - `frontend/src/components/common/MobileSidePanel.jsx` refactored:
    - Links are now generated by mapping over arrays.
    - Uses the custom `Button` component for auth links (Login/Register).
    - Close icon changed to `MdClose` (from `react-icons/md`) to align with project dependencies.
  - (Previous) Integrated `MobileSidePanel` into `frontend/src/components/common/NavBar.jsx` with toggle functionality.
- **Books Page (Previous)**: Implemented with search, list, and card components.
- **Responsiveness**: Home and Chatbot pages are responsive.
- **Chatbot UI**: Updated message input and session history panel.
- **Layout**: `PageShell.jsx` for conditional `NavBar`/`Footer`.
- **Componentization**: `ChatInterface.jsx` refactored.
- **Pages**: Chatbot, Register, Login pages created.
- **Core Components**: Footer, Banners, FAQ, Features, Buttons, NavBar.
- **Setup**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, global styles.

**Memory Bank:**

- `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated to reflect the detailed implementation of the backend chatbot agent logic (`chatbot_agent.py`) and the corresponding frontend integration in `ChatInterface.jsx`.
- (Previous) `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated to reflect the addition of custom styling options for Markdown elements in `MessageItem.jsx`.
- (Previous) `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated to reflect the integration of `react-markdown` and `remark-gfm` in `MessageItem.jsx`.
- (Previous) `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated to reflect the frontend integration of the `/api/agent/chatbot` streaming API using `fetch`.
- (Previous) `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated to reflect the new `/chatbot` agent route.
- (Previous) `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` updated to reflect the refactoring of `MobileSidePanel.jsx` (mapped links, Button component usage, react-icons for close icon).
- (Previous) All core memory bank files updated to reflect the latest backend authentication refinements, including secure user data responses.

## What's Left to Build

**Backend:**

- **Username Handling (Optional)**: Decide if and how `username` will be managed post-registration.
- **Protected Routes**: Implement JWT-based authentication middleware/decorator.
- **User Profile Management**: API endpoints for user profile operations.
- **Celery Worker Verification**: Ongoing monitoring.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive testing for all API endpoints and services.
- **Core Functionalities**: Implement ADK agents and other primary API routes (chat, Q&A).

**Frontend:**

- **Update Auth Forms & Logic**: Adapt registration and login logic to handle the curated `user` object and the token returned.
- **Auth Integration**: Connect UI to backend auth endpoints.
- **Token Handling**: Manage JWT on the client-side.
- **Protected Routes (Frontend)**: Implement route guards.
- **UI Development**: Continue building out features.

## Current Status

**Backend**: Authentication system is robust, production-oriented, provides a token immediately upon registration, and now returns curated user data in responses. MongoDB is integrated.
**Frontend**: Foundational UI established. Key next step is integrating with the refined backend authentication.
The project is actively in full-stack development.

## Known Issues

- **`SECRET_KEY` Configuration**: User MUST set a strong `SECRET_KEY` in `server/.env`.
- **`MONGO_URL` Configuration**: User MUST ensure `MONGO_URL` is correctly set in `server/.env`.
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `PINECONE_INDEX_NAME` need to be correctly set in `server/.env`.
- Pinecone index creation defaults might need adjustment based on user's Pinecone setup.
