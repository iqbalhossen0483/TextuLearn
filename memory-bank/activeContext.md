# Active Context: AI Book Agent Platform

## Current Work Focus

The primary focus has been on integrating the Celery queue system with Redis into the backend. This involved:

- Adding `celery` to `server/requirements.txt`.
- Configuring Celery in `server/config/settings.py`.
- Creating `server/celery_app.py` to initialize the Celery application.
- Refactoring `server/services/queue_manager.py` to define and use Celery tasks.
- Updating memory bank documentation to reflect the change from RQ to Celery.

## Recent Changes

- `server/requirements.txt`: Updated to add `celery`.
- `server/config/settings.py`: Updated to include Celery broker and result backend URLs.
- `server/celery_app.py`: Created to initialize the Celery application.
- `server/services/queue_manager.py`: Modified to define a sample Celery task.
- `server/app.py`: Will be modified to integrate with Celery (future step).
- `server/routes/main.py`: Will be updated to use Celery tasks (future step).
- Memory bank files (`techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated to reflect Celery integration.

## Next Steps

With the integration of Celery, the next steps will involve:

- Modifying `server/app.py` to integrate with the Celery queue system.
- Updating `server/routes/main.py` to use Celery tasks.
- Verifying the end-to-end functionality by running the Flask application and a Celery worker.
- Proceeding with the implementation of other core backend functionalities, including Google ADK agents, services, and API routes.
- Integrating with Pinecone and Google Gemini.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- Ensuring consistent environment setup across development machines.
- Confirming the stability and performance of the Redis connection for asynchronous tasks with Celery.
- Designing how Celery tasks will be further utilized by other services and agents for specific AI tasks.
