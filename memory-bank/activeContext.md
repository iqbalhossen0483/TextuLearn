# Active Context: AI Book Agent Platform (Backend Server)

## 1. Current Work Focus

The current focus is on establishing the foundational memory bank for the AI Book Agent Platform backend and organizing the initial project structure.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **`PRD.md` Added**: The `PRD.md` file was initially added to the project root.
- **Memory Bank Initialized**: The core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated with information extracted from `PRD.md`.
- **`PRD.md` Relocated**: The `PRD.md` file has been moved from the project root to the `server/` directory as instructed.

## 3. Next Steps

The memory bank has been fully updated and the initial file organization is complete. The next steps will involve beginning the implementation of the backend server as outlined in the `PRD.md` and the memory bank.

## 4. Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Backend-Only Scope**: The project is strictly backend-focused for now. Frontend considerations will be deferred.
- **File Organization**: All backend server files will be kept inside the `server/` folder.
- **Memory Bank as Source of Truth**: The memory bank is now fully initialized and will serve as the primary reference for all future development tasks.
